# Expo ImagePicker: Intermittent Null URI Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using the Expo ImagePicker library. The issue involves the library occasionally returning a null or undefined URI after an image has been successfully selected by the user. This behavior is inconsistent and difficult to reproduce reliably.

## Problem Description

The core problem is that `image.uri` from the `ImagePicker.launchImageLibraryAsync` result is sometimes null or undefined, even when the selection process appears to complete successfully.  This makes accessing the selected image impossible. 

## Steps to Reproduce (Inconsistent)

While precise reproduction steps are elusive, it seems related to the device's state, network conditions, or timing issues.  Thorough investigation is needed.

## Proposed Solution (in bugSolution.js)

The provided solution attempts to address this inconsistency.  It includes additional error checks and a retry mechanism to potentially mitigate the problem.
